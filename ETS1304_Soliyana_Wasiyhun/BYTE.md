# Algorithm of Question number 5

A serial transmission line can transmit 960 characters a second. Write a program that will calculate how long
it will take to send a file, given the file size. Test your program on a 400MB (419,430,400 byte) file which may
take days?

## Psedocode

step_1: start

step_2: input(size)

step_3: calculate time as time=size/transimsion rate(0.00096)

step-4: print time

step_5: end

## Flow char 

``` mermaid
  graph TD;
    A(start) --> B[ Read input of the size]
    B[ Read input of the size]--> C[Calculate time as time time=size/transimsion rate -0.00096]
    C[Calculate time as time time=size/transimsion rate _0.00096]-->D[Print time ]
    D[Print time ]-->E(End)
