inpu(weight, height)
calculation(BMI = w/h*h)
out put
 normal body mass index (BMI) is between 18.5 and 24.9:

    Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
    Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
    Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
    Obese: BMI is 30 or more

Algorithm
start 
read the input(w,h)
orperation BMI= w/h*h 
print BMI 
end
