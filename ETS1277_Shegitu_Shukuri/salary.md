 Design an algorithm and write a to read an employee name weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour and
base salary and find the employees gross-salary, net salary and bonus payment. (Hint: pension rate – 5%,
tax: 15%). 

Input - employee's name
      - number of weekly working hours
      - bonus rate per hour
      - base salary
Output  - gross salary
              as gross salary = base salary + (weekly working hour * bonus rate)
        - pension deduction
              as pension dedicution = 0.05 * gross salary
        - tax deduction 
              as tax deduction = 0.15* gross salary
        - net salary
              as net salary = gross salary -(pension deduction* tax deduction)
        - total bonus payment
              as bonus payment = weekly working hours* bonus rate

Algorithm

step1: start
step2: read the employee's name
step3: read the number of weekly working hours
step4: read the bonus rate per hour
step5: read the base salary
step6: calculate gross salary (gross salary=  base salary + (weekly working hour * bonus rate))
step7: calculate the pension deduction ( pension deduction = 0.05 * gross salary)
step8: calculate the tax deduction (tax deduction = 0.15* gross salary)
step9: calculate the net salary (gross salary -(pension deduction                   * tax deduction))
step10: calculate the total bonus payment( bonus payment = weekly working hours* bonus rate)
step11: print employee's name, gross salary, net salary,and bonus payment
step11: end
