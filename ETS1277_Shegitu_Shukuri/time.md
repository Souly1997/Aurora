A serial transmission line can transmit 960 characters a second. Write a program that will calculate how long
it will take to send a file, given the file size. Test your program on a 400MB (419,430,400 byte) file which may
take days.

Input - size of file in MB
Operation:
  -size in bytes = size*1024*1024
  -time in secinds = size in bytes / transmission rate
  -time in hours = time in seconds / 3600
  -time in days = time in hours / 24
Out put - time taken in seconds, hours, days.

Algorithm
step1: start
step2: input the file of size in MB
step3: convert the input size from MB to bytes (size in bytes = size*1024*1024)
step4: calculate time in seconds( time in seconds = size in bytes/transmission rate
step5: calculate time in hours (time in seconds/3600)
step6: calculate time in days (time in hours/24)
step7: print time taken in seconds, hours and days
step8: end
