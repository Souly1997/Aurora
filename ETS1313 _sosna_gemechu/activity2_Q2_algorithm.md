#Algorithm of
Write a program that prompts the capacity in gallons of an automobile fuel tank and the miles per gallons
the automobiles can be driven. The program outputs the number miles the automobile cam be driven
without refueling.

* start
* read input (capacity in gallon and fuel in gallon the automobile can drive for 1 mile)
* calculate number of mile the automobile can drive as
  
 1 mile = gallon automobile can drive
  
  required mile=gallon capacity
  
  so to find the required mile=gallon capacity*1mile/gallon automobile can drive in 1 mile
  * print the mile required with out refueling
