/* Make a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person and determine weather the person is
in normal weight, under weight or over weight. BMI is calculated as (BMI = w/h*h). Make the program to
work for multiple person before terminated.*/

Input -weight
      -height
      -BMI = weight/(height*height)
Output -under weight,if BMI is less than 18.5
       -Normal weight, if BMI is between 18.5-24.9
       -Overweight, if BMI is between 25.0-29.9
       -Obese, if BMI is morethan 30
 Algorithm
 step1: start
 step2: read weight
 step3: read height
 step4: operate BMI= weight/(height*height)
 step5: print BMI
 step6: end
